# Flappy Bird

This is a simple Flappy Bird game implemented using SDL in pure C.
This is my first project using SDL.

It has no dependencies other than the C standard library, SDL2 and SDL_ttf.
I implemented a very basic SDL game framework that could be reused fairly easy for other simple games

### Controls
